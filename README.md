# CS 255 Portfolio – System Analysis and Design

## Project Summary
The DriverPass project focused on designing an online driver training system for a client seeking to improve student success rates on DMV driving exams. The client, DriverPass, wanted a web-based system that allows customers to purchase lesson packages, schedule driving lessons, take online practice tests, and track progress, while also providing administrative tools for staff and owners.

## What did I do particularly well?
I did particularly well translating the client interview and requirements into clear, structured documentation. The business requirements document thoroughly captured both functional and nonfunctional requirements, while the system design document clearly illustrated system behavior through UML diagrams. This ensured that all stakeholder needs were addressed before implementation.

## What would I revise or improve?
If I could revise one part of my work, I would expand on edge cases and exception handling in the system design, such as failed payments or scheduling conflicts. Adding more detailed error-handling scenarios would further strengthen the design and prepare the system for real-world use.

## How did I interpret user needs and implement them?
I focused on the needs of each user role—customers, secretaries, administrators, and owners—and ensured the system supported their specific tasks. Considering user needs is critical because a system that is difficult to use or does not match real workflows will fail regardless of technical quality. The UML diagrams helped validate that each requirement was properly supported.

## How do I approach designing software?
I approach software design by first understanding the problem domain and user needs, then breaking the system into manageable components. In the future, I will continue using techniques such as requirement analysis, UML modeling, and iterative refinement to ensure systems are scalable, secure, and maintainable.
